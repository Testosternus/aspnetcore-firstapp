# About
This is my first app I developed within ASP.NET Core. It's a simple Web App that transforms some text into other format and does basic calculations.

# History
As an exercise to follow along an ASP.NET course.

# Usage
Run the WebApplication in the .sln file, you can follow the list to take you to their respective pages. You could also add `/Texts` or `100/200` to the Home page for additional results.
